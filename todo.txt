Todo:
- parser to recognise order of ops
- test binary op. append (and make sure it throws an exception is non-associative)

FUTURE:
- tests for all global objects (e.g. wrap, bool_permuatations, operator (making new operators, testing stringification for order etc.))
- show working steps?
- CLI + GUI
- simplifier
- circuit diagram
- configuration e.g. default symbol, new operations
- parser exceptions to show entire expression in raw form, using character indicies, arrows, etc.
