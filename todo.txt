Todo:
- clean up the parser (this is almost done)
- unconditionals as terms (and tests for this)
- test binary op. append (and make sure it throws an exception is non-associative)
- more tests for the parser...if i dont go any more insane

FUTURE:
- tests for all global objects (e.g. wrap, bool_permuatations, operator (making new operators, testing stringification for order etc.))
- expression classes accepting strings?
- show working steps?
- CLI + GUI
- simplifier
- circuit diagram
- configuration e.g. default symbol, new operations
- parser exceptions to show entire expression in raw form, using character indicies, arrows, etc.
